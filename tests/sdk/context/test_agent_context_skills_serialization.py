"""Tests for the auto-loaded-skills serialization optimisation.

When ``load_user_skills`` / ``load_public_skills`` are enabled,
``AgentContext._load_auto_skills`` resolves every matching skill and
appends it to ``self.skills`` at model-validation time. Persisting
those skills on the wire is pure duplication — the validator runs
again on every deserialization and rebuilds the same set deterministically.

The serializer drops auto-loaded skills from ``model_dump`` output but
keeps the in-memory ``self.skills`` intact so runtime prompt rendering
behaves exactly as today. These tests pin both halves of that contract.
