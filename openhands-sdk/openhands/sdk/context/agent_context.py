    AgentContext unifies all the contextual inputs that shape how the system
    extends and interprets user prompts. It combines both static environment
    details and dynamic, user-activated extensions from skills.

    Specifically, it provides:
    - **Repository context / Repo Skills**: Information about the active codebase,
      branches, and repo-specific instructions contributed by repo skills.
    - **Runtime context**: Current execution environment (hosts, working
      directory, secrets, date, etc.).
    - **Conversation instructions**: Optional task- or channel-specific rules
      that constrain or guide the agent’s behavior across the session.
    - **Knowledge Skills**: Extensible components that can be triggered by user input
      to inject knowledge or domain-specific guidance.

    Together, these elements make AgentContext the primary container responsible
    for assembling, formatting, and injecting all prompt-relevant context into
    LLM interactions.

        The runtime keeps the full resolved list on ``self.skills`` so
        prompt rendering and downstream consumers behave exactly as
        today. Only the wire payload changes: callers re-loading the
        model will trigger ``_load_auto_skills`` again, which rebuilds
        the auto-loaded subset deterministically from the same
        ``load_user_skills`` / ``load_public_skills`` /
        ``marketplace_path`` configuration.

        Equality (not just name match) is required because consumers
        like OpenHands' ``_create_agent_with_skills`` replace
        auto-loaded skills in-place with their own version under the
        same name. A name-only filter would silently drop those
        replacements and the receiver would auto-reload the stock
        version on the next deserialization.

        Opt-out via ``context={"preserve_full_skills": True}``: paths
        that need a stable snapshot of the resolved skill catalog (the
        most important one being ``ConversationState._save_base_state``
        — persistence of the conversation to disk) pass this flag so
        the serializer is a no-op. Without it, a paused conversation
        resumed after the ``~/.openhands/skills`` directory or the
        public marketplace updated would silently pick up the *new*
        skill content via ``_load_auto_skills``. The API-response path
        skips the flag and gets the byte-size win.

        Config-drift safety: if the auto-load config
        (``load_user_skills`` / ``load_public_skills`` /
        ``marketplace_path``) changed since the snapshot was taken —
        typically via ``model_copy(update=...)`` flipping one of those
        flags — the trim is skipped. Otherwise the receiver would
        either re-load a *different* skill catalog (changed
        ``marketplace_path``) or fail to re-load at all (flag turned
        off), losing the auto-loaded skills entirely.

        ``mode="wrap"`` + ``handler`` delegation preserves caller
        options like ``exclude_none``, ``exclude_defaults``, and
        nested ``include`` / ``exclude`` for the surviving skills —
        manual ``s.model_dump(...)`` would have ignored them.

        the wire payload — this validator re-runs on every model load,
        so the same skills repopulate without needing to be persisted.

        Two behaviour modes, switched by
        ``context={"loading_from_snapshot": True}``:

        Fresh construction (default, no flag):
            - Skills the loader returned that aren't already in
              ``self.skills`` get appended and tracked as auto-loaded.
            - Skills the loader returned that ARE already in
              ``self.skills`` (caller-supplied explicit) are left
              alone — even if they happen to equal the loader output.
              The caller pinned that content deliberately; treating it
              as auto-loaded would let a later marketplace update
              silently swap it on the next round-trip.

        Loading from a persisted snapshot (``loading_from_snapshot``):
            - The persisted ``skills`` list IS authoritative. Don't
              append new auto-loaded skills — that would let a
              marketplace update or a fresh skill file silently
              pollute the snapshot on the next save.
            - Skills already in ``self.skills`` that equal the
              loader's current output get marked as auto-loaded so
              the next serialize trims them (migration path: old
              persisted conversations shrink on first reload through
              the new SDK).
            - Skills in ``self.skills`` that DON'T match the loader's
              current output (user edited the file, marketplace
              updated since the snapshot was taken) stay explicit so
              the on-disk content wins.

        The persistence load path in
        ``ConversationState`` factory sets the context flag. API-
        response paths and direct caller construction don't, so they
        get fresh-construction semantics.

        subprocess which environment variables are available.  The actual secret
        values are injected into the subprocess environment by
        ``ACPAgent._start_acp_server``; the prompt block only advertises their
        names so the agent knows to use them.

        ``user_message_suffix`` is a compatible field but is not emitted here
        because ``LocalConversation`` already applies it through
        ``event.to_llm_message()``; including it would duplicate it.
