"""API request and response models for settings endpoints.

These models define the contract between SDK clients and agent-server settings
endpoints. They are defined in the SDK so both packages can share them without
circular dependencies (SDK cannot import from agent-server, but agent-server
can import from SDK).

Server-side usage:
    The agent-server imports these models and uses them as FastAPI response_model.

Client-side usage:
    RemoteWorkspace uses these models to validate responses from settings APIs.
    Use the typed accessor methods (``get_agent_settings()``,
    ``get_conversation_settings()``) to parse the raw dicts into typed models.

Note on dict fields:
    ``SettingsResponse`` uses ``dict[str, Any]`` for ``agent_settings`` and
    ``conversation_settings`` rather than typed models because the server needs
    to control how secrets are serialized (plaintext/encrypted/redacted) via
    serialization context. Typed Pydantic fields would lose this context during
    FastAPI's automatic JSON serialization.

    Clients that need type safety should use the accessor methods which validate
    the dicts into ``AgentSettingsConfig`` and ``ConversationSettings``.
